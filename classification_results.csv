Curfew login blocker with ASL and GH for Utah minors,"To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH to apply only within Utah boundaries. The feature activates during restricted night hours and logs activity using EchoTrace for auditability. This allows parental control to be enacted without user-facing alerts, operating in ShadowMode during initial rollout.","The feature explicitly cites compliance with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, which mandates age verification and parental control mechanisms. The use of ASL to detect minors, GH for geographic enforcement, and EchoTrace for auditability aligns with legal provisions such as restricted hours for minors and parental access requirements. Jurisdictional alignment with Utah is confirmed, and credible legal evidence (SB0152) supports these requirements.",LegalRequirement
PF default toggle with NR enforcement for California teens,"As part of compliance with California's SB976, the app will disable PF by default for users under 18 located in California. This default setting is considered NR to override, unless explicit parental opt-in is provided. Geo-detection is handled via GH, and rollout is monitored with FR logs. The design ensures minimal disruption while meeting the strict personalization requirements imposed by the law.","The feature explicitly mentions compliance with California's SB976, which imposes restrictions on addictive social media features for minors. The disabling of PF (Personalized feed) aligns with the legal requirement to obtain parental consent before exposing children to such features. Geographic restrictions and parental opt-in mechanisms directly correspond to the law's provisions.",LegalRequirement
Child abuse content scanner using T5 and CDS triggers,"In line with the US federal law requiring providers to report child sexual abuse content to NCMEC, this feature scans uploads and flags suspected materials tagged as T5. Once flagged, the CDS auto-generates reports and routes them via secure channel APIs. The logic runs in real-time, supports human validation, and logs detection metadata for internal audits. Regional thresholds are governed by LCP parameters in the backend.","The feature explicitly aligns with US federal law (18 U.S. Code ยง 2258A) requiring providers to report child sexual abuse content to NCMEC. The functionality, including real-time scanning, flagging, auto-generating reports, and secure routing, directly corresponds to statutory obligations. Jurisdictional alignment is confirmed as the feature operates within the USA, matching legal requirements.",LegalRequirement
Content visibility lock with NSP for EU DSA,"To meet the transparency expectations of the EU Digital Services Act, we are introducing a visibility lock for flagged user-generated content labeled under NSP. When such content is detected, a soft Softblock is applied and GH ensures enforcement is restricted to the EU region only. EchoTrace supports traceability, and Redline status can be triggered for legal review. This feature enhances accountability and complies with Article 16's removal mechanisms.","The feature explicitly references compliance with Article 16 of the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), which mandates removal mechanisms for flagged content. Geographic enforcement restricted to the EU aligns with DSA jurisdiction. Traceability and legal review processes further support accountability as required by the regulation.",LegalRequirement
Jellybean-based parental notifications for Florida regulation,"To support Florida's Online Protections for Minors law, this feature extends the Jellybean parental control framework. Notifications are dispatched to verified parent accounts when a minor attempts to access restricted features. Using IMT, the system checks behavioral anomalies against BB models. If violations are detected, restrictions are applied in ShadowMode with full audit logging through CDS. Glow flags ensure compliance visibility during rollout phases.","The feature explicitly supports Florida's Online Protections for Minors law, with mechanisms like parental notifications and compliance visibility directly tied to legal requirements. Graph RAG evidence aligns with Florida's statutes on restricting minors' access to harmful content.",LegalRequirement
Unified retention control via DRT & CDS,"Introduce a data retention feature using DRT thresholds, ensuring automatic log deletion across all regions. CDS will continuously audit retention violations, triggering EchoTrace as necessary. Spanner logic ensures all platform modules comply uniformly.","The feature describes a data retention mechanism with automated log deletion and compliance auditing. However, no legal evidence or jurisdictional context is provided to confirm it as a LegalRequirement. Similarly, while the feature could be BusinessDriven, there is no explicit business motivation cited. The absence of legal citations and unclear intent necessitates human review.",LegalRequirement
NSP auto-flagging,"This feature will automatically detect and tag content that violates NSP policy. Once flagged, Softblock is applied and a Redline alert is generated if downstream sharing is attempted.","The feature mentions the detection and tagging of content violating an 'NSP policy,' but there is no legal evidence or jurisdictional context provided. The absence of credible legal provisions, coupled with the lack of clarity on whether this policy is legally mandated or business-driven, results in insufficient information to classify it definitively.",LegalRequirement
T5 tagging for sensitive reports,"When users report content containing high-risk information, it is tagged as T5 for internal routing. CDS then enforces escalation. The system is universal and does not rely on regional toggles or GH routes.","The feature describes a system for tagging and escalating high-risk content, enforced universally without regional toggles. However, no legal evidence was found to confirm it as a LegalRequirement. Similarly, there is insufficient clarity on whether this is driven by business motivations, as no explicit business strategy or experimentation context is provided. The lack of jurisdictional alignment or credible legal provisions further complicates classification.",LegalRequirement
Underage protection via Snowcap trigger,"Snowcap is activated for all underage users platform-wide, applying ASL to segment accounts. Actions taken under this logic are routed to CDS and monitored using BB to identify deviations in usage.","The feature description mentions age-sensitive logic and compliance-related systems, but no legal evidence or jurisdiction-specific requirements were found to support classification as a LegalRequirement. Similarly, there is no clear business motivation or experimentation context to classify it as BusinessDriven. The intent remains ambiguous without further clarification.",LegalRequirement
Universal PF deactivation on guest mode,"By default, PF will be turned off for all uses browsing in guest mode.","The feature disables PF (Personalized feed) for guest mode by default. No legal evidence or jurisdictional requirements were found to suggest this is legally mandated. The decision appears driven by product strategy, such as enhancing user privacy perception or simplifying guest mode functionality.",BusinessDriven

This feature logs resharing attempts with EchoTrace and stores activity under BB.","The feature enables resharing stories with auto-expiry and logs activity for anomaly detection. No legal evidence or jurisdiction-specific requirements were found. The functionality appears driven by product strategy, such as enhancing user engagement or improving anomaly detection systems.",BusinessDriven
Leaderboard system for weekly creators,Introduce a creator leaderboard updated weekly using internal analytics. Points and rankings are stored in FR metadata and tracked using IMT.,"The feature describes the introduction of a creator leaderboard updated weekly using internal analytics, stored in metadata, and tracked via an internal monitoring trigger. There is no mention of legal provisions, regulatory obligations, or jurisdiction-specific constraints. The lack of legal evidence and the focus on internal mechanisms suggest a business-driven motivation such as performance tracking or experimentation.",BusinessDriven
Mood-based PF enhancements,Adjust PF recommendations based on inferred mood signals from emoji usage. This logic is soft-tuned using BB and undergoes quiet testing in ShadowMode.,"The feature involves adjusting personalized feed recommendations based on inferred mood signals from emoji usage, which appears to be a product experimentation or optimization strategy. There is no cited legal evidence or jurisdictional alignment to suggest this is driven by regulatory requirements. The use of Baseline Behavior (BB) and ShadowMode testing further supports a business-driven motivation focused on performance improvement.",BusinessDriven
New user rewards via NR profile suggestions,"At onboarding, users will receive NR-curated profiles to follow for faster network building. A/B testing will use Spanner.","The feature involves A/B testing and curated profiles for faster network building, which aligns with business motivations like experimentation and growth.

Trial run of video replies in EU,"Roll out video reply functionality to users in EEA only. GH will manage exposure control, and BB is used to baseline feedback.","The feature involves geographic restrictions aligning with the EEA, which suggests potential legal relevance. However, the Graph RAG evidence retrieved does not provide clear, specific legal provisions directly tied to video reply functionality or exposure control mechanisms. While the Digital Services Act (DSA) is mentioned, no explicit passages demonstrate a direct constraint or obligation for this feature. The lack of conclusive legal evidence and absence of strong business motivation indicators results in insufficient scoring for both LegalRequirement and BusinessDriven categories.",LegalRequirement
Canada-first PF variant test,Launch a PF variant in CA as part of early experimentation. Spanner will isolate affected cohorts and Glow flags will monitor feature health.,"The feature involves launching a PF variant in California, which aligns with the jurisdiction of SB 976. The bill defines 'addictive feed,' which may apply to personalized feeds, and mandates parental consent for children's access. Geographic alignment and legal provisions suggest compliance-driven constraints.",LegalRequirement
Chat UI overhaul,"A new chat layout will be tested in the following regions: CA, US, BR, ID. GH will ensure location targeting and ShadowMode will collect usage metrics without user impact.","Evidence is weak; lacks direct legal mapping, but jurisdictions and triggers suggest potential relevance.",LegalRequirement
Regional trial of autoplay behavior,"Enable video autoplay only for users in US. GH filters users, while Spanner logs click-through deltas.","The feature restricts video autoplay to US users, which aligns with geographic boundaries. However, the legal evidence retrieved (18 U.S. Code ยง 2258A) primarily discusses reporting requirements and does not clearly mandate or constrain video autoplay functionality. While there is a jurisdiction match, no explicit legal provisions directly support this feature. The lack of clear business motivation also prevents confident classification as BusinessDriven. Thus, intent remains ambiguous.",BusinessDriven
South Korea dark theme A/B experiment,A/B test dark theme accessibility for users in South Korea. Rollout is limited via GH and monitored with FR flags.,"The feature involves A/B testing of a dark theme for users in South Korea, which is a product experimentation strategy. There is no legal evidence or jurisdiction-specific requirements cited. Geographic restrictions appear to be driven by rollout strategy rather than legal mandates.",BusinessDriven

EchoTrace will log adjustments, and CDS will verify enforcement across rollout waves.","The feature involves age-tailored notifications and references systems like ASL and CDS, which could imply regulatory compliance or business-driven motivations. However, no legal evidence was found to confirm LegalRequirement status. Without jurisdiction-specific data or explicit legal provisions, the intent remains ambiguous.",LegalRequirement
Chat content restrictions via LCP,"Enforce message content constraints by injecting LCP rules on delivery. ShadowMode will initially deploy the logic for safe validation. No explicit mention of legal requirements, but privacy context is implied.","The feature mentions enforcing message content constraints using LCP rules and implies a privacy context, but there is no explicit legal evidence or jurisdictional alignment to classify it as a LegalRequirement. Similarly, while ShadowMode deployment suggests safe validation, there is insufficient clarity on whether this is driven by business motivations or legal obligations. The absence of legal citations and detected jurisdictions further complicates classification.",LegalRequirement
Video upload limits for new users,Introduce limits on video uploads from new accounts. IMT will trigger thresholds based on BB patterns. These limitations are partly for platform safety but without direct legal mapping.,"The feature introduces video upload limits for new accounts based on internal monitoring triggers and baseline behavior patterns, stated as being partly for platform safety. However, there is no direct legal mapping or credible legal provision cited in the evidence. The motivation appears aligned with platform safety and anomaly detection, which are business-driven decisions rather than legally mandated requirements.",BusinessDriven

The logic applies generally and is monitored through EchoTrace, with no mention of regional policies.",Original evidence lacks jurisdiction details but aligns with legal-centric features in similar cases.,LegalRequirement
User behavior scoring for policy gating,Behavioral scoring via Spanner will be used to gate access to certain tools. The feature tracks usage and adjusts gating based on BB divergence.,"The feature description involves behavioral scoring and gating access to tools based on usage divergence, which appears motivated by operational or product strategy rather than legal requirements. No legal evidence or jurisdictional alignment was found, and the context lacks references to specific legal provisions.",BusinessDriven
Minor-safe chat expansion via Jellybean,"We're expanding chat features, but for users flagged by Jellybean, certain functions (e.g., media sharing) will be limited. BB and ASL will monitor compliance posture.",Ambiguous evidence; lacks explicit legal citations or clear business intent.,LegalRequirement
Friend suggestions with underage safeguards,"New suggestion logic uses PF to recommend friends, but minors are excluded from adult pools using ASL and CDS logic. EchoTrace logs interactions in case future policy gates are needed.","The feature description mentions age-sensitive logic (ASL) and a Compliance Detection System (CDS), which could imply compliance-related intent. However, no legal evidence or jurisdiction-specific requirements were found to substantiate this as a 'LegalRequirement.' Similarly, while the feature could be business-driven, there is insufficient clarity on whether the exclusions and logging are motivated by experimentation, optimization, or other business goals. The absence of clear legal or business context necessitates human review.",LegalRequirement
Reaction GIFs with embedded filtering,"Enable GIFs in comments, while filtering content deemed inappropriate for minor accounts. Softblock will apply if a flagged GIF is used by ASL-flagged profiles.","The feature involves filtering content for minor accounts and applying a softblock for flagged GIFs used by ASL-flagged profiles. However, no legal evidence was found to support these actions as legally mandated. The absence of detected jurisdictions and credible legal provisions prevents classification as a LegalRequirement. Similarly, there is insufficient clarity on business motivations or product strategy to classify this as BusinessDriven. The intent remains ambiguous without further context or evidence.",LegalRequirement
Longform posts with age-based moderation,"Longform post creation is now open to all. However, moderation for underage authors is stricter via Snowcap.","The feature mentions stricter moderation for underage authors but provides no explicit legal basis or jurisdictional context. Without supporting legal evidence or clear business motivation, the intent remains ambiguous.",LegalRequirement
